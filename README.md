Simple compiler and parser written in Ruby as way for me to learn about these things and Ruby.

Based off the works by Steven Ferg <http://www.ferg.org/> and his examples in Python.

Work in progress.

#### Examples
So far, look in <https://github.com/parse/boatcaptain/blob/master/output/LexerDriverOutput.txt>, <https://github.com/parse/boatcaptain/blob/master/output/ParserDriverOutput.txt> and <https://github.com/parse/boatcaptain/blob/master/output/ScannerDriverOutput.txt> for example output.
